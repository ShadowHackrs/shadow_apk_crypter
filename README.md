# Shadow APK Crypter ‚Äì HellGate v2.0

An advanced tool for merging and encrypting APKs with different payloads, designed to provide multiple layers of protection and obfuscation.

**Note:** This project is a prototype and requires further development.

## ‚ú® Overview

Shadow APK Crypter is a sophisticated tool designed to merge and encrypt Android applications (APK files) with malicious payloads in a way that makes detection and analysis significantly more difficult. Its primary function is to "wrap" the payload within a legitimate (clean) application and apply multiple layers of protection and concealment.

## üî• Key Features

* Advanced payload encryption using multiple layers (XOR, RC4, Compression, Base64)
* Code and string obfuscation
* Anti-debugging and anti-emulator protection
* Generation of fake metadata
* Support for changing app icon and name
* Automatic APK signing
* Boot-time execution capability
* Multiple encryption layers
* Custom protection mechanisms

## üì¶ Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Java JDK 8+
* Android SDK (for aapt2)
* `apktool.jar`
* `uber-apk-signer.jar`

## üîß Installation

1. Install Python requirements:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Place the following files in the `tools/` folder:

    *   `apktool.jar`
    *   `uber-apk-signer.jar`
    *   `keystore.jks` (optional)

3. Place the clean target APK in `libs/CleanApp.apk`.
4. Place your payload APK in `payloads/CraxsRat.apk`.

## üöÄ Usage

To run the tool, execute the `build_forge.py` script:

```bash
python build_forge.py
```

The resulting encrypted and merged APK will be located in the `output/` directory.

##   Ô∏è Core Components

### Main Scripts
* `shadow_apk_crypter.py`: Main script managing encryption and merging
* `payload_encrypter.py`: Handles payload encryption with multiple layers
* `build_forge.py`: Orchestrates the APK decompilation, injection, and rebuilding process
* `injector.py`: Injects the payload into the clean app and handles package name changes
* `inject_obfuscate.py`: Performs class name and string obfuscation

### Smali Components
* `smali/`: Contains modified Smali files:
  * `Utils.smali.txt`: Decoding utility for encrypted strings
  * `BootReceiver.smali.txt`: Handles boot-time execution

## üîÑ Build Process

1. **Decompilation**
   * Decompiles both CleanApp.apk and payload APK using apktool
   * Converts to Smali format in tmp/ directory

2. **Payload Injection**
   * Copies payload Smali files to clean app's Smali directory
   * Integrates payload functionality with clean app

3. **Manifest Modification**
   * Adds necessary permissions for payload functionality
   * Generates and applies random package name
   * Updates manifest entries

4. **Code Protection**
   * Applies string encryption
   * Performs class name obfuscation
   * Injects anti-debug and anti-vm protection
   * Adds fake code and metadata

5. **Rebuilding**
   * Rebuilds modified Smali files into APK
   * Signs the final APK
   * Outputs to output/ directory

## üîí Security Features

* **Multiple Encryption Layers**
  * XOR encryption
  * RC4 encryption
  * Data compression
  * Base64 encoding

* **Anti-Analysis Protection**
  * Anti-debugging mechanisms
  * Anti-emulator detection
  * Code obfuscation
  * String encryption

* **Stealth Features**
  * Random package name generation
  * Fake metadata injection
  * Boot-time execution
  * Background service integration
